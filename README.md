# TODO


// localStorage             
// dates            
// figure out sublists              

// drag and drop API            
// https://web.dev/drag-and-drop/       

// <select> pulldown for priority (maybe put this into expanded card and not normal todo)        

// filling project field moves delete button and date; keep everything anchored                   
// input areas still aren't obvious enough          
// date field is full width / shows white while outer div is hovered            
// make clickable area only below todos to create new todo      

// userselect none on sidebar, legend
