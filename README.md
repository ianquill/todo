# TODO

// prevent more than one new note from being created before any edits have been made    
    // make an array of current todo cards, check last item added to it?    

// localStorage             
// dates            
// figure out sublists              

// drag and drop API            
// https://web.dev/drag-and-drop/       

// <select> pulldown for priority (maybe put this into expanded card and not normal todo)
