# TODO
// sidebar functionality      

// initialization:
// first look through all notes and make a project item for each project found
// clicking one of these sorts by that keyword
// each time a note is created / edited, refresh the project list


// ability to add new todo
// make editing fields more obvious

// localStorage             
// dates            
// figure out sublists              

// drag and drop API            
// https://web.dev/drag-and-drop/       

// <select> pulldown for priority (maybe put this into expanded card and not normal todo)
